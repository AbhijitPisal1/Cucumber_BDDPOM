## Cucumber_BDDPOM

Welcome to the **Cucumber_BDDPOM** repository. This project demonstrates the use of **Cucumber** for Behavior Driven Development (BDD) in conjunction with **Selenium** and **TestNG** for test automation. The repository follows a Page Object Model (POM) and uses Cucumber annotations for test steps, ensuring maintainable and scalable test scripts. This repository is specifically designed to automate the purchasing function of the Sauce Demo application.

## Repository Overview

This repository is an excellent starting point for developers wishing to learn about **Cucumber** for Behavior Driven Development (BDD) in **Java**, **Selenium**, and **TestNG** for test automation. The project applies the **Page Object Model (POM)** pattern and provides the automated test scripts for the **Sauce Demo** application to simulate purchasing items. The repository also demonstrates how to effectively set up and organize your tests with **Cucumber**.

## Technologies Used

For details on the technologies used in this project, refer to the `pom.xml` file for configuration.

## Installation Instructions

To get started with this repository on your local machine, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites:
1. Ensure you have **Java 8+** installed on your machine.
2. You will need **Maven** to build the project and handle dependencies.
3. **IDE**: Use an IDE like **IntelliJ IDEA** or **Eclipse** to open and work with the repository.

### Steps to Clone and Set Up:
```plaintext
1. **Clone the repository**:
   git clone [https://github.com/AbhijitPisal1/Cucumber_BDDPOM.git](https://github.com/AbhijitPisal1/Cucumber_BDDPOM.git)
   cd Cucumber_BDDPOM

2. **Build the project** using Maven:
   mvn clean install

3. **Run the tests** using Maven:
   mvn test
```

This will set up the project and execute the tests defined in the MytestRunner class.

## Folder Structure
The repository is organized into several folders to structure the project in a clean and maintainable way. Here’s a breakdown of the folder structure:

### Source Code
- **src/test/java**: Contains Java files for test execution.
  - **base folder**: Contains TestBase.java for setting up common driver-related functions.
  - **pages**: Contains multiple page objects that implement the Page Object Model (POM) and PageFactory pattern for cleaner and reusable test code.
  - **runners**: Contains the MytestRunner.java file for managing test execution.
  - **stepDefs**: Contains the OrderStepDefs.java file for defining step definitions using TestNG and Cucumber annotations. It also includes the Hooks.java file for setting up the driver before tests and attaching screenshots on test failures.

### Resources
- **src/test/resources**: Contains feature files written in **Gherkin** syntax for the book search functionality.
  - **features folder**: Contains the PlaceOrder.feature file, which defines the test scenarios in Gherkin syntax for Behavior Driven Development (BDD).
